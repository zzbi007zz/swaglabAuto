# SwagLabs Automation with CodeceptJS

SwagLabAuto is an automation testing project for the SwagLabs demo website. It uses CodeceptJS, a modern end-to-end testing framework, to automate various user flows and test scenarios.

## Features

- End-to-end testing of key user flows on the SwagLabs website
- Tests login, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout functionalities  
- Page object model for better test organization and maintainability
- Generates detailed HTML reports of test results using Mochawesome

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Chrome or Firefox web browser

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

3. Install the dependencies:

## Running Tests
